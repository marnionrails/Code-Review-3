## Description

This web application takes a number from a user and returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user inputted number with the following exceptions:
* Numbers that contain a 1: all digits are replaced with "Beep!"
* Numbers that contain a 2: all digits are replaced with "Boop!"
* Numbers that contain a 3: all digits are replaced with "Won't you be my neighbor?"
* Note that these exceptions are written from least to most important, which means that if one digit meets the 1st exception but another digit meets the 2nd exception, "Boop!" but NOT "Beep!" is outputted, and so on and so forth.
